# Contributing to Cilium CLI

## Contribution workflow

Cilium CLI uses GitHub for collaborative development. This repository only hosts
release artifacts for Cilium CLI. The actual code for Cilium CLI is in
[Cilium GitHub repository] under [`cilium-cli/` directory]. Please use GitHub
issues to discuss proposals and use pull requests to suggest changes in
[Cilium GitHub repository]. For more information see the [Development Guide].

## Slack

Most developers are using the [Cilium & eBPF
Slack](https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/community/community/#slack) to communicate
outside of GitHub.

## Code of conduct

All members of the Cilium community must abide by the [Cilium Community Code of
Conduct](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Only
by respecting each other can we develop a productive, collaborative community.
