# Code owners groups and a brief description of their areas:
# @cilium/ci-structure       Continuous integration, testing
# @cilium/github-sec         GitHub security (handling of secrets, consequences of pull_request_target, etc.)
# @cilium/tophat             Catch-all for code not otherwise owned

# The following filepaths should be sorted so that more specific paths occur
# after the less specific paths, otherwise the ownership for the specific paths
# is not properly picked up in Github.
